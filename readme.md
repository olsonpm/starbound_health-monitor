### What is it?
A health monitor which beeps and bleeds when your character is low on health.


### Why create it?
My siblings and I were clumsy, not paying attention to our health and dying
unexpectedly.  In our defense the health bar is way top left!


### How to install it?
[Like this](docs/how-to-install.md)


### Health monitor details

- The beep is the same one triggered upon low-hunger.

Don't worry, the beep won't double up on you if you're both low on health
and hunger

- Configurable in-game

When you activate the health monitor (left clicking on the screen while it's
equipped), a window appears allowing you to configure what health percent
triggers the beeping and bleeding.  It also allows you to enable or disable the
health monitor.


- Accessible and opt-in

You start with one in your space locker and you can purchase them for cheap at
the Infinity Express if you lose it.  If you don't have a health monitor in your
inventory then it's life as normal for you.


- Doesn't drop when you die


- Health monitor settings persist with your character


### Limitations

- This mod must be installed on both the server and client.
Assuming it's even possible, if someone wants to create a pull request
implementing a reasonable solution to making this client-only then go for it.


### Todo ideas
If people find this mod useful then I may work on the following ideas.

- A toggle to disable the blood or beep individually
- Gore mode
- Automatically consume a heal item

Suggestions welcome
